{"name":"Versioner","tagline":"","body":"Versioner\r\n=========\r\n\r\nGit versioning and tagging without the hassle.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n**Versioner** helps automate version bumping and tagging in Git applications. Once you have set up your local Git config to point to the location of the application version tagging is easy. **Versioner** will automatically:\r\n\r\n- Bump the version number\r\n- Commit the changes\r\n- Merge them into master\r\n- Tag the version\r\n- Switch back to the development branch\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- Bash\r\n- Git\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nTo install download the [latest version](https://github.com/TheConnMan/Versioner/archive/master.zip) and extract `versioner` into a permanant location. You can also move `versioner` to a location in your path for convenience.\r\n\r\n### Local Config Setup\r\n\r\nBefore using **versioner** you'll need to set a few configs within your local git repository. You can use the **Setup Wizard** or **Default Setup** below to get started. Additional info about the setup items is also below.\r\n\r\n#### Setup Wizard\r\n\r\nThere is a setup wizard to help with initial setup. Run `versioner -w` to use this wizard.\r\n\r\n#### Default Setup\r\n\r\nThere is an option to set up and default config if the project is a **Grails** project. Run `versioner -s grails` to use this default setup.\r\n\r\n##### Branch\r\n\r\nThe development branch is the branch where the version will be incremented and committed. This branch will then be merged into master and switched back to after completion.\r\n\r\n##### File\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to set the file which contains your application version number. This file path must be a relative path from the root of the project to the file.\r\n\r\n##### Context\r\n\r\nTo find and replace the version number within the file above a little context is needed. Set the **context** to the contents of the line containing the version number in the file above. For example, the following file would use the context [**app.version=**].\r\n\r\n```\r\n#Grails Metadata file\r\n#Sun Jan 1 13:15:17 EST 2014\r\napp.grails.version=2.3.0\r\napp.name=myapp\r\napp.servlet.version=3.0\r\napp.version=1.1.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\nTo increment the version of an app run **versioner** in the root directory of your git repository with the following options:\r\n\r\nUsage: `versioner [-v version] [-t tag message] [-s setup] [-Mmbwh]`\r\n- -v: version number\r\n- -t: tag message\r\n- -s: setup type (grails)\r\n- -M: Major version bump\r\n- -m: Minor version bump\r\n- -b: Build version bump\r\n- -w: Setup wizard\r\n- -h: help\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n**Versioner** allows you to specify a sepcific version using the `-v` option, or specify and **Major** (`-M`), **Minor** (`-m`), or **Build** (`-b`) level bump. Any of these three flags will auto-increment that build level and set and lower levels to zero (e.g. **1.1.1** -> **2.0.0**).\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nPlease use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TheConnMan/Versioner.git) to recommend additions or report bugs.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT","google":"UA-48858955-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
